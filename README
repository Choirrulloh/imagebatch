Image Batch Processing

These scripts make it easy to upload large numbers of images (from a
scanner or digital camera, for example), process them together (e.g.
rescale them all to the same size), and turn them into web pages.

They run on Unix systems (other restrictions as noted) though it might
not be too hard to port them to other operating systems.  They're
written in a motley collection of csh, perl and python.  Most of them
use ImageMagic, plus a few other tools like exiftran and jhead.
